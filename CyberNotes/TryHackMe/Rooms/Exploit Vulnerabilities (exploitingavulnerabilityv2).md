## Automated Vs. Manual Vulnerability Research
+ Vulnerability scanner like [Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus) or Metasploit can automatize Vulnerability Research
+ Can be Open source or not

| **Vulnerability**          | **Description**                                                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Security Misconfigurations | Due to developer oversight (exposing server information in messages between the application and an attacker) |
| Broken Access Control      | Access parts of an application that are not supposed to be                                                   |
| Insecure Deserialization   | Insecure processing of data that is sent across an application. (Pass malicious code to the application)     |
| Injection                  | Input malicious data into an application (Due to the failure of not sanitizing)                              |
| Remote code execution      | Execute code on the distant machine                                                                          |
## Finding Manual Exploits
**Rapid7** : Online, Vulnerability and PoC
**GitHub** : Public, unfiltered / unverified
**Searchsploit** : Offline copy of Exploit-DB
