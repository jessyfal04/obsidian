## About Me
I'm a 20-year-old Master's student from France with a strong passion for securing internet communications, networks, and cloud systems.

I'm determined to specialize in cybersecurity and broaden my expertise by pursuing a PhD in Japan or South Korea.

I'm particularly interested in working for R&D-focused companies like Nintendo, where cloud technology plays a major role.
