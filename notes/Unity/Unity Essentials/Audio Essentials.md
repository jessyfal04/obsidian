| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| The Audio Listener component acts as a microphone-like device. It receives input from any given Audio Source in the scene and plays the sounds through the computer speakers. | True    |
| The more Audio Listener components you have in a scene, the louder the volume will be.                                                                                        | False   |
| For most applications, it makes sense to attach the Audio Listener component to the Main Camera.                                                                              | True    |
| You need two Audio Listener components in the scene to act as the left and right audio channels.                                                                              | False   |

## Question 2

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| By exporting the audio clip to an external audio editing software.                                                  | False   |
| Previewing is not available in Unity; audio clips must be applied to an Audio Source to be heard.                   | False   |
| Using the Preview panel at the bottom of the Inspector window when an audio clip is selected in the Project window. | True    |
| Through the Console window after writing a custom script to play audio clips.                                       | False   |
## Question 3
What effect does setting the Spatial Blend of an Audio Source to 2D have on the sound?
Select the one correct answer.

| It causes the sound to be affected by the game world's physics, such as echoes and reverberation.           | False   |
| It ensures the sound's volume and presence are consistent throughout the scene, without positional changes. | True    |
| It restricts the sound to play only when the player is in specific, predetermined locations in the scene.   | False   |
| It enables the sound to change direction based on the player's movements and actions within the game.       | False   |
