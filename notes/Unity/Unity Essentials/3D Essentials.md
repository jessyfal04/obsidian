## Review
A vertex (plural: vertices) is a point in where the edges of shapes meet — like a corner. In Unity, vertex snapping is a feature that allows you to perfectly align the vertices of different GameObjects to one another by snapping them together. 
Hold down the V key on your keyboard while you left-click one of the bottom vertices of a block you want to put on top of another.

## Question 2
When you add a primitive 3D shape to your Unity scene, what happens? 
Select the two correct answers.

| Answers                                                                                                                            | Correct |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| A primitive 3D shape is added to the scene with a collider component attached, allowing it to interact with other physics objects. | True    |
| Each primitive 3D shape automatically includes a Rigidbody component for physics-based movement and interactions.                  | False   |
| The object is placed at the origin of the scene (X=0, Y=0, Z=0).                                                                   | False   |
| The shape appears with a default gray material, giving it a basic appearance until further customization.                          | True    |
## Question 3
Which of the following best describes the process for creating a new blue material in Unity? 
Select the one correct answer.


| Answers                                                                                                                                                  | Correct |

| Directly in the Scene view, right-click a GameObject, select Material > New Material, and set its color to blue using the Inspector window.              | False   |
| Right-click in the Hierarchy window, select Create > Blue Material, and the material is automatically added to your project with the default blue color. | False   |
| From the Project window, select Create > Material, then in the Inspector window, use the Color picker (⊙) to change the material's color to blue.        | True    |
| Enter Play mode, then generate a new material by pressing Ctrl+M (macOS: Cmd+M).                                                                         | False   |

| The Mesh Renderer component determines the appearance of a GameObject, but it does not affect the object's physical properties or interactions.  | True    |
| The Transform component allows a GameObject to transform into any other GameObject when Spacebar is pressed. It is optional for all GameObjects. | False   |
| The Rigidbody component adds physics properties to a GameObject, allowing it to react to forces and collisions within the game environment.      | True    |

## Question 5
What happens when you move and rotate the Directional Light in a scene?
Select the one correct answer.

| Answers                                                                                                                                            | Correct |

| Rotating the Directional Light changes the direction of shadows and lighting in the scene, but moving it does not have any effect on the lighting. | True    |
| Moving the Directional Light closer to objects makes them brighter, while rotating it affects the color temperature of the scene.                  | False   |
| Moving and rotating the Directional Light will change the color of the light, affecting the mood of the scene.                                     | False   |
