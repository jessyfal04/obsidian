# My Path for my Future

## Which field
### Research

I don't know what to do but I wanna touch to :
- Network
- Security
- Communications / API 
- Games / Progressive Web App
### Work

I wanna work at :
- Nintendo European Research and Development (NERD)
- Nintendo in Japan
	- Security measures of Network Service Development [Link](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/jobs/introduction/engineer/soft-network.html)
		- Game Network Engineer
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Game's Weaknesses</mark> [Link](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/jobs/keyword/77.html)
	- Corporate IT Security [Link](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/jobs/introduction/engineer/soft-it.html)
		- Corporate IT Security Engineer
	-   Server Security Engineer

But I think I should prioritize my research interest over my future work interest. 

## Which path

I'm currently in my first year of Cyber-security in France

I can :
- Try a PhD at KAIST after my master's in France
- Try a Ms+PhD for the Fall 2025 (Early)
- Do not do a PhD and try to work in Japan

### If a PhD, which lab at KAIST ?
