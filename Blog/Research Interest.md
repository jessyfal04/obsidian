### Game Engine : Library Programmer  
- Develop functions to make hardware functions easier, safer, and easier to use
- Develop low-layer libraries such as memory management
### Game Engine : Build Engineer  
- Identify development processes that should be automated, and automate builds and tests  
- Identify test cases according to the system, and develop a system to execute them and improve test efficiency  
- Development programmers for tools and engines that support game development
### Target: Operating Systems and Large Software Systems[](https://compsec.postech.ac.kr/research/#target-operating-systems-and-large-software-systems)

- Lead: Prof. Seulbae Kim
- Subject systems: Linux/Windows Kernel, web browsers, …

###### 1. Automatically identifying non-memory issues (e.g., performance deradation)[](https://compsec.postech.ac.kr/research/#1-automatically-identifying-non-memory-issues-eg-performance-deradation)

- Key question: How to design test oracles and testing methodologies for the issues that do not readily manifest (e.g., performance degradation)?

###### 2. Efficiently testing emulated systems[](https://compsec.postech.ac.kr/research/#2-efficiently-testing-emulated-systems)

- Key question: Emulation comes at a cost of (terrible) performance. Can we somehow skip the slow part for testing purposes?

###### 3. Improving fuzzing methodologies[](https://compsec.postech.ac.kr/research/#3-improving-fuzzing-methodologies)

- Keywords: Directed fuzzing, AI-assisted fuzzing, in-memory fuzzing, …

###### 4. Automated Game testing[](https://compsec.postech.ac.kr/research/#4-automated-game-testing)
