- Target : Software Security (especially Video Games)
- Finally, there is a segmentation of the video game testing papers. Our dataset contains papers that pertain to Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science, Software Engineering, and Video Game Design. These different fields have different goals. [...] A proper solution for automated video game testing needs all these fields of study working together. A new field of study andâ€“or specific venues for discussing this matter need to arise.
  -> Lab with both AI and Computer Security ~~
- "Video games, aside from having code, also integrate artistic elements (sound, 2D/3D graphics, narrative, etc.)"
  -> How to patch this with LLM ?
